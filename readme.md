<h3>Naming conventions:</h3>
  - variables (including functions and defines) don't start with capital letters or any character out of alpha-category
(so, you can't start a function name, for example, with a capital letter like 'A' or with a number or a symbol like '-')
  - constants may not contain any capital letter and if it's name is made out of few words, they will be split-up by underscores
  - classes always will have a header (.hpp or .h) and a main file (.cpp file)

Today tasks:
- [ ] Create a nice state screen (aka: ScreenManager) class (Main one)
- [ ] Look at some artwork from the designer
- [ ] Plan ideas
